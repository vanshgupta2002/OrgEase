# Organ-Donation-Database-Management-System

Problem Statement and Solution :-

The topic at hand is the ORGAN DONATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, which is an essential tool for tracking and managing organ transplantation procedures. Organ transplantation involves the removal of an organ from one person and transplanting it into another person who needs it due to a damaged or missing organ.

Organ Donation and Procurement Organizations (ODPOs) play a critical role in the process of organ transplantation. They are responsible for evaluating and procuring organs for transplantation, identifying suitable candidates for available organs, and coordinating with medical institutions to decide on each organ recipient. They also educate the public about organ donation to increase awareness and participation.

The Organ Donation and Procurement Network Management System is a database management system that uses advanced database technology to construct, maintain, and manipulate various kinds of data about a person's donation or procurement of a particular organ. This database contains a comprehensive medical history and critical information like blood group and age of every person in the network. It also keeps track of all transplantation operations that have been carried out to date.

In summary, the Organ Donation Management Database is a crucial tool for managing and tracking organ transplantation procedures. ODPOs play a pivotal role in the process of organ procurement and transplantation, and the database keeps comprehensive records of all transplantation operations carried out to date. This system serves as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers in the field of organ transplantation.
